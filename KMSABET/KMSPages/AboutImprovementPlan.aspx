    <h3>Improvement Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Processes to ensure continuous improvement of the quality of a system are called Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) processes. Academic programs require
        CQI to attain a certain level of satisfaction of the learning outcomes. These processes are required for a program to be accredited by ABET or other
        similar accrediting agencies (Prof. Dr. Imam &amp; Prof. Dr. Tasadduq, 2012). While expert system technologies have been successfully developed and
        deployed in such diverse disciplines as Engineering, Business, Mining, Medicine, etc. (Ahmad et al 2008; Marakas, 2013; Negnevitsky, 2013; Turban and
        Aronson, 2013), little efforts have been expended in employing decision support and expert system methodologies in the important area of CQI/Accreditation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The expert system for improvement of the teaching a course has not been implemented earlier. For CQI, there will be a knowledge base containing rules added
        by the industry experts. Each rule will be associated with a single CLO (course learning outcome) and each rule yield suggestion(s) for that CLO. The
        multiple choice questions (MCQs) will be presented to instructor and his/her answers will be processed in an inference engine which will output the
        suggestion(s) based on the provided rules added by the industry experts.
    </p>
    <p>
        An expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by
        reasoning about knowledge, represented primarily as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. An expert system is divided into two
        sub-systems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the
        known facts to deduce new facts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another potential application of expert system in the context of CQI/Accreditation may be in the treatment of a weakness in a particular learning outcome.
        If at the end of a course, it is found that the satisfaction criterion for an outcome has not been achieved e.g., less than 70% students are able to obtain
        more than 70% marks in a particular learning outcome, a continuous improvement plan is required to improve the situation when the course is taught next
        time. The possible treatments may include, more homework, more quizzes, arranging tutorials, re-sequencing the order of topics taught, toughening the
        admission policy, etc. Similar other areas of possible application of expert system may be explored.<em></em>

        ABET is a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and
        engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.<em></em>
    </p>
    <p>
        ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which the program
        prepares its students. ABET accredits postsecondary programs housed in degree-granting institutions which have been recognized by national or regional
        institutional accreditation agencies or national education authorities worldwide.<em></em>
